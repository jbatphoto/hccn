Manual Setup
-

To set up a Craft CMS site, first download it with Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/johanneslamers/craft-workflow projectname
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd projectname
bash install.sh
```

```bash
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run **`npm start`** to run Gulp.
Your finished site will be created in a folder called `public` , viewable at this URL:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run

**`npm run build`**


Tasks
-


* ```gulp watch``` to start the watch task, at the moment you will have to use a browser extention for live reload.

* ```gulp``` to build for production, all the magic happens and template files will be moved to ```craft/templates```, resources (images/js/css) will be concatinated, minified and wrapped in silk before they end up in ```/public```.

* ```gulp bower``` Injects bower dependencies into ```_layout.html```. This task will run on ```gulp watch``` as well.
_Remember to ```--save``` when installing components_.
